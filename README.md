# Farmhouse - Right out of farm

Farmhouse gives a solution to a major obstacle to increasing farmers’ income which are profitable intermediaries such as commission agents, investors, and wholesalers who take a primary bite of benefit from farmers’ produce and leave very little for the farmers.


Through Farmhouse farmers can directly sell their goods to vendors. Thereby eliminating the middlemen and assuring quality.
